AP19-OLR challenge sets three tasks that will be evaluated and ranked separately.

Task 1: Short-utterance LID, where the test utterances are as short as 1 second.

Task 2: Cross-channel LID, where test data is in different channels from the training set.

Task 3: Zero-resource LID, where no resources are provided for training before inference, but several reference utterances are provided for each language.
